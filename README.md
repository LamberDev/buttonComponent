# Getting Started with Button Component 😁

This project is a simple exercise to learn the philosophy of programming through small components, their usability and reusability.

I have tried to follow good practices, I have not included the use of hooks or state since the scope was not that.

All feedback is welcome.✌😊

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
